        <p>Hi. My name is Brian de Raad. I've attended classes at the College of San Mateo, Cañada College, and Skyline College, and have an Associates in Art in music with guitar as my main instrument. I worked at Bimbo Bakeries USA for over 8 years as a Data Support Specialist, but tech is where my heart is. I’ve been a fencer for many years and in the last couple years have been addicted to cycling.</p>
        <p id="reason">I am attending this class because I am pursuing an Associates in Science degree in Web and Mobile Application Development and this class is a big part of the major. I have already taken classes on Java, C++, PHP, SQL, Javascript/jQuery, HTML/CSS, and iOS/Swift. Now it is time to put some of these together.</p>
