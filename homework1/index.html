        <p>Hi. My name is Brian de Raad. I've attended classes at the College of San Mateo, Cañada College, and Skyline College, and have an Associates in Art in music with guitar as my main instrument. I’ve been a fencer for many years, a cyclist for the last few, backpacked recently (hadn't done this since high school), and just started taking a swim stroke development class. And, I plan on snowboarding for the 1st time next month. Whew, that's a lot of sports.</p>
        <p id="reason">I am attending this class because I am pursuing an Associates in Science degree in Web and Mobile Application Development. I have taken various programming/scripting classes, including HTML/CSS and Javascript which will be used in this course. I'm excited to see the best use of these technologies in web and mobile apps.</p>
